# fastack
fastack [fa(st) stack] is a web application built using NodeJS and ExpressJS that makes
starting your next web app easy, fast, and un-intimidating. 

Choose your framework, add the features you need, download the template. Cool!

## Easy?
There isn't much to the application's interface, making it darn near impossible to 
get lost and/or confused along the way. If you do get confused, please send complaints
to `[REDACTED]`.

## Fast?
The process isn't instantaneous, but it's a lot faster than looking up the documentation
to the framework you've used a hundred times before but still forget how to get a simple
API up and running. fastack does all that for you, all in a single click.

## Un-intimidating?
When your manager, professor, etc. ask you for all these big features in this allegedly
"small" web app like "APIs", "User Provisioning", "[insert buzzword here]", your
knees may begin to shake. Heck, by the time you add all those you'll have no time to
make the custom bits! Well wouldn't you know, fastack takes on that worry like a sponge.
Let it's simple, colorful, well-designed interface absorb all that stress and anxiety -- 
just click a few buttons and wait a second or two. *Phew!*

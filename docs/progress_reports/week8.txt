Week 8 Progress Report
(11/6/18 - 11/13/18)

This week I started to implement the add features section.
This will allow users more control over the projects that
are generated, so they don't have to stick to the defaults
if they don't want to. This week I was able to add features
and configuration settings for Angular, Node, and Vue.
React will come soon but I ran out of time this week.

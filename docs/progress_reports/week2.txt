Week 2 Progress Report
(9/25/18 - 10/2/18)

This week I put together a document specifying the more technical side
of the project in regards to creating the stacks. I looked up some of
the pre-built packages and tools to quickly generate a new project in
the given framework. From there, I put together some resources to
begin to derive how to add some of the other features (like user
provisioning and DB connections) programmatically.

Most of the progress this week was done in ./docs/stacks_cli.txt and
./docs/stack_diagram.png
